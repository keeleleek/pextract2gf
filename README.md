# Translator from pextract XML to Grammatical Framework

_This code is currently being [rewritten in a separate project](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf-votic) to be more language neutral and become part of a general user interface for an [extract morphology](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) based "morphology lab" for easier creation of large scale morphological dictionary using Korp's corpus searches and Karp's dictionary system._


The translator was written to bootstrap the [Votic morphology module](https://github.com/keeleleek/GF-Votic) for the Grammatical Framework. It has the potential to help others bootstrap their morphology and lexicon resource building with paradigms extracted with [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract).

This work depends on the [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) tool and the [pextract-xml](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract-xml) for interfacing the extracted paradigms file.
