# Translator from pextract XML to Grammatical Framework

Bootstrap Grammatical Framework morphology and lexicon resource building with paradigms extracted with [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract).

This work depends on the [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) tool and the [pextract-xml](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract-xml) for interfacing the extracted paradigms file.
